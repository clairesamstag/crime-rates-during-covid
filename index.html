        <p>Over the last decade, crime rates in the United States, particularly violent crimes, have fluctuated with significant regional disparities. However, no period has been as disruptive as the years shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <p>Quarantines, economic uncertainty, and global societal changes during the pandemic left an indelible mark on crime trends across the nation. This trend is the most evident in New York State, where the contrast between New York City and other regions shows a vivid picture of the pandemic’s impact on violent crime.</p>

        <p>For much of the 2010s, violent crime in New York City steadily declined. Tailored efforts to improve policing, enhance community engagement, and sustain economic growth helped reduce crime rates to historic lows. Suburban and rural areas outside the city experienced declines as well, although less noticeable. However, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 triggered an unprecedented reversal of these trends. According to my data, while New York City’s violent crime rates soared to levels unseen in over a decade, regions outside the city experienced smaller but noticeable increases, reflecting national patterns of disruption. </p>

        <p>By 2019, violent crime across the state had reached a relative low point. Within the first few months of the beginning of the pandemic, violent crime began to rise dramatically. In New York City, cases surged past 60,000 by 2022, while other non- New York City regions also saw an uptick. The isolation and uncertainty made violence more likely.

        <p>Ronald Sussman, an auxiliary police sergeant in New York City and a patroller for the Mohawk County reserve in upstate New York said that he notices a general greater sense of fear in the public since the pandemic.</p>

        <p>“It seems to me that there's been an uptick in the public human eye, of their perception that they are less safe whether they're walking down the street and they're wary of people coming and ripping off a piece of jewelry or cell phone or just knocking them over because they're going the wrong way on a scooter (...) there's a sense that I have as a I patrol the streets and listen to the public, that they feel less safe,” Sussman said.</p>

        <p>Economic instability during the pandemic was one of the primary drivers of this surge. As businesses closed and unemployment skyrocketed, many people started to feel desperate. Crimes of opportunity, such as robberies, became more frequent, particularly in New York City. At the same time, economic struggles in rural areas fueled a different kind of hopelessness, contributing to rises in drug-related violence and property crimes.</p>

        <p> According to a John Hopkins interview with Stephanie Desmon, the spike in gun violence during the year of 2021 can in large part be attributed to the level of fear that was circulating surrounding the pandemic.</p>

        <p>“There was a lot of uncertainty,” Desmon said. “We had the insurrection on the Capitol, we had a lot of protests and uprisings around racial justice, and a lot of people just felt insecure. Unfortunately, folks turned to purchasing guns, at record numbers.”
</p>

        <p>A closer examination of the data reveals important regional differences. While New York City saw violent crime skyrocket, areas outside the city experienced a more tempered increase. In Albany County, for instance, violent crime rose during the pandemic, but the increase was far less dramatic than in the city. This discrepancy highlights how population density, socioeconomic conditions, and law enforcement resources influenced crime trends. Suburban and rural areas often benefit from tighter-knit communities and less concentrated poverty, which can mitigate some of the forces that drive urban crime. Nonetheless, even in these regions, the pandemic disrupted long-standing patterns, with increases in domestic violence and drug-related offenses.
</p>

        <p>Sussman, who has a central observance both inside and outside of the city on crime, said that there are “palaple differences” between the two regions. 
</p>

        <p>“You don't have the level of concern outside the city that you have in the city,” Sussman said. “You go into Walmart here and the deodorant is locked up. You go into the drugstores in New York City to buy toothpaste and you have to have the cabinets unlocked for you, so yeah there's physical, palpable differences that you can see and touch and therefore feel.”
.</p>

        <p>The data suggests that many of the underlying drivers of the recent crime surge—economic inequality, mental health challenges, and strained community resources—may have lasting effects. Policymakers face the daunting task of addressing these systemic issues to ensure that the pandemic’s disruption does not leave a permanent mark on the nation’s public safety landscape.
</p>

        <p>In New York City, authorities are exploring innovative approaches to stem the tide of violence. Programs aimed at interrupting cycles of violence, expanding mental health support, and providing economic opportunities are at the forefront of these efforts. Similarly, suburban and rural areas are experimenting with strategies tailored to their unique needs, such as investing in drug rehabilitation and strengthening community policing initiatives. These efforts underscore the importance of a multifaceted response to the pandemic’s legacy of crime.
</p>

        <p>“I think your perception of violent crime is probably connected to how you feel,” Sussman argued. It’s connected to whether you're talking about cities or non cities, because the cities are where most of the people who are less well off reside, and hence, where more crime occurs”
</p>

        <p>The pandemic may have been an anomaly, but it serves as a powerful reminder of the need for resilience and adaptability in ensuring public safety.
